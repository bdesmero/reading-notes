# How Google Works

Eric Schmidt & Jonathan Rosenberg

## 1. Culture - Believe Your Own Slogans

### Culture
* Smart creatives, though, place culture at the top of the list. To be effective, they need to _care_ about the place they work.
* People who believe in the same things the company does will be drawn to work there, while people who don't, won't. 
* A stagnant, overly "corporate" culture is anathema to the average smart creative.
* well-established and well-understood company culture - It becomes the basis for everything you and the company do; it is the safeguard against something going off the rails, because it _is_ the rails.

### Office
* Offices should be designed to maximize energy and interactions, not for isolation and status. Smart creatives thrive on interacting with each other.
* Messiness is not an objective in itself, but since it is a frequent by-product of self-expression and innovation, it's usually a good sign.
* We invest in our offices because we expect people to work there, not from home. Working from home during normal working hours, which to many represents the height of enlighetened culture, is a problem that - as Jonathan frequently says - can spread throughout a company and suck the life out of its workplace.
* Make your offices crowded and load them with amenities, then expect people to use them.

### Decision-making
* When it comes to the quality of decision-making, pay level is intrinsically irrelevant and experience is valuavle only if it is used to frame a winning argument.
* "_If we have data, let's look at data. If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine._" - Jim Barksdale (CEO of Netscape)
* "_It is the quality of the idea that matters, not who suggests it._" - Shona Brown
* Meritocracies yield better decisions and create an environment where all employees feel values and empowered.

### Organization structure
* keep it flat
* rule of seven - managers have a _minimum_ of seven direct reports
* flatter charts with less managerial oversign and more employee freedom
* avoid secret organizational documents
* teams be small enough to be fed by two pizzas. Small teams get more done than big ones, and they spend less time politicking and worrying about who gets credit.
* Decide who runs the company not based on function or experience, but by performance and passion.
* "_Your title makes you a manager. Your people make you a leader._" - Debbie Biondolillo (Apple's former head of human resources)
* At the most senior level, the people with the greatest impact - the ones who are running the company - should be product people.
* at least 50 percent of the people at the table should be experts in the company's products and services and responsible for product development. This will help ensure that the leadership team maintains focus on product excellence.
* Once you identify the people who have thje biggest impact, give them more to do. When you pile more responsibility on your best people, trust that they will keep taking it on or tell you when enough is enough.
* If you want something done, give it to a busy person.

### Attitude
* There are tipping points in knave density. It approaches a critical mass - which is smaller than you think - and people start to believe that they need to be knave-like to succeed, which only exacerbates the problem.
* Knaves prioritize the individual over the team; divas think they are better than the team, but want success equally for both.

### Work-life balance vs Overwork
* For many people, work is an important part of life, not something to be separated.
* keep the work part lively and full; it's _not_ a key component of your job to ensure that employees consistently have a forty-hour workweek.
* tell them to own the things for which they are responsible, and they will do what it takes to get them done. Give them the space and the freedom to make it happen.
* burnout isn't caused by working too hard, but by resentment at having to give up what really matters to you. Give your smart creatives control, and they will usually make their own best decisions about how to balance their lives.
* No one should or can be indispensable.

### Culture of Yes
* No is a signal that the company has lots its start-up verve, that it's too corporate. Enough no's, and smart creatives stop asking and start heading to the exits.
* "_My first word of advice is this: Say yes. In fact, say yes as often as you can. Saying yes begins things. Saying yes is how things grow. Saying yes leads to new experiences and new experiences will lead you to knowledge and wisdom.... An attitude of yes is how you will be able to go forward in these uncertain times._" - Michael Hogan (American academic and former University of Connecticut president)

### fun vs Fun
* A great start-up, a great project - a great job, for that matter - should be fun, and if you're working your but-off without deriving any enjoyment, something's probably wrong. Part of the fun comes from inhaling the fumes of future success. But a lot of it comes from laughing and joking an enjoying the company of your coworkers.
* The fun comes from everywhere. The key is to set the boundaries of what is permissible as broadly as possible.

### Leadership
* the CEO who picks up the stack of newspapers outside the front door, the founder who wipes the counters. With these actions, the leaders demonstrate their egalitarian natures - we're all in this together and none of us are above the menial tasks that need to get done. Mostly, though, they do it because they care so much about the company. Leadership requires passion. If you don't have it, get out now.

## 2. Strategy - Your Plan is Wrong


### Flexibility
* Successful teams spot the flaws in their plan and adjust.
* although your plan might change, it needs to be based on a foundational set of principles that are grounded in how things work today and that guide your plan as it shape-shifts its way to success. The plan is fluid, the foundation is stable.
* Smart creatives relish the "we'll figure it out approach"

### Technical insights
* What is the technical insight upon which those new features, products, or platforms will be built? A technical insights is a new way of applying technology or design that either drives down the cost or increases the functions and usability of the product by a significant factor. The result is something that is better than the competition in a fundamental way. The improvement is often obvious; it doesn't take a lot of marketing for customers to figure out that this product is different from everything else.
* conventional MBA approach - figuring out what they are best at (competitive advantage)
* You will never disrupt an industry or transform your business, and you'll never get the best smart creatives on board, if your strategy is narrowly based on leveraging your competitive advantage to attach related markets.
* develop technical insights:
  * use some of [these] accessible technologies and data and apply them in an industry to solve an existing problem in a new way
  * start with a solution to a narrow problem and look for ways to broaden its scope
* When you base your product strategy on technical insights, you avoid me-too products that simply deliver what customers are asking for.
* "If I had listened to my customers, I would have gone out looking for faster horses." - Henry Ford
* if you are starting a new venture or trying to transform an existing enterprise, it's (incremental innovation) not enough

### Scaling
* If you are trying to do something big, it's not enough just to grow, you need to _scale_ - grow something very quickly and globally
* Competition is much more intense and competitive advantages don't last long, so you have to have a "grow big fast" strategy.
* Platform - a set of products and services that bring together groups of users and providers to form multisided markets.
* the priority was to grow, not to make more money
* a successful foundation must provide a good basis for revenue generation
* important benefit of platforms: As they grow and get more valuable, they attract more investment, which helps to improve the products and services the platform supports.
* in the technology industry, companies always think "platforms, not products"

### Resourcefulness
* companies are outsourcing more functions and working with a bigger and more diverse network of partners
* "the Internet has caused transaction costs to plunge so steeply that it has become much more useful to read Coase's law, in effect, backward: Nowadays firms should shrink until the cost of performing a transaction internally no longer exceeds the cost of performing it externally." - Don Tapscott in _Wikinomics_
* [These companies] assembled existing technology components in new ways to reimagine existing businesses. They set up plaforms for customers and partners to interact, and use those platforms to create highly differentiated products and services.

### Specialize
* sometimes the best way to grow a platform is to find a specialy that has the potential to expand

### Openness
* Platforms generally scale more quickly when they are open.
* sharing more intellectual property such as software code or research results, adhering to open standards rather than creating your own, and giving customers the freedom to easily exit your platform.
* With open, you trade control for scale and innovation. And trust that your smart creatives will figure it out.
* drives innovation into the ecosystem and drives down the cost of complementary components -> more value for users and more growth for the new ecosystem
* allows you to harness the talents of thousands of people
* "no matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else." - Bill Joy, Sun cofounder
* open-sourcing
  * no hidden agendas
  * we are committed to growing a platform, an industry, and an ecosystem as a whole
* user-freedom
  * Make it easy for customers to leave.
  * When customers have low barriers to exit, you have to work to keep them.

### Following competition
* This fixation leads to a never-ending spiral into mediocrity.
* as Larry Page says, how exciting it is to come to work if the best you can do is trounce some other company that does roughly the same thing?
* If you focus on your competition, you will never deliver anything truly innovative.
* Our job is to think of the thing you haven't though of yet that you really need.
* "You must be proud of your enemy; then your enemy's successes are also your successes." - Nietzsche in _Thus Spake Zarathustra_
* Be proud of your competitors. Just don't follow them.
