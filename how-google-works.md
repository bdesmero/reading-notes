# How Google Works

Eric Schmidt & Jonathan Rosenberg

## 1. Culture - Believe Your Own Slogans

### Culture
* Smart creatives, though, place culture at the top of the list. To be effective, they need to _care_ about the place they work.
* People who believe in the same things the company does will be drawn to work there, while people who don't, won't. 
* A stagnant, overly "corporate" culture is anathema to the average smart creative.
* well-established and well-understood company culture - It becomes the basis for everything you and the company do; it is the safeguard against something going off the rails, because it _is_ the rails.

### Office
* Offices should be designed to maximize energy and interactions, not for isolation and status. Smart creatives thrive on interacting with each other.
* Messiness is not an objective in itself, but since it is a frequent by-product of self-expression and innovation, it's usually a good sign.
* We invest in our offices because we expect people to work there, not from home. Working from home during normal working hours, which to many represents the height of enlighetened culture, is a problem that - as Jonathan frequently says - can spread throughout a company and suck the life out of its workplace.
* Make your offices crowded and load them with amenities, then expect people to use them.

### Decision-making
* When it comes to the quality of decision-making, pay level is intrinsically irrelevant and experience is valuavle only if it is used to frame a winning argument.
* "_If we have data, let's look at data. If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine._" - Jim Barksdale (CEO of Netscape)
* "_It is the quality of the idea that matters, not who suggests it._" - Shona Brown
* Meritocracies yield better decisions and create an environment where all employees feel values and empowered.

### Organization structure
* keep it flat
* rule of seven - managers have a _minimum_ of seven direct reports
* flatter charts with less managerial oversign and more employee freedom
* avoid secret organizational documents
* teams be small enough to be fed by two pizzas. Small teams get more done than big ones, and they spend less time politicking and worrying about who gets credit.
* Decide who runs the company not based on function or experience, but by performance and passion.
* "_Your title makes you a manager. Your people make you a leader._" - Debbie Biondolillo (Apple's former head of human resources)
* At the most senior level, the people with the greatest impact - the ones who are running the company - should be product people.
* at least 50 percent of the people at the table should be experts in the company's products and services and responsible for product development. This will help ensure that the leadership team maintains focus on product excellence.
* Once you identify the people who have thje biggest impact, give them more to do. When you pile more responsibility on your best people, trust that they will keep taking it on or tell you when enough is enough.
* If you want something done, give it to a busy person.

### Attitude
* There are tipping points in knave density. It approaches a critical mass - which is smaller than you think - and people start to believe that they need to be knave-like to succeed, which only exacerbates the problem.
* Knaves prioritize the individual over the team; divas think they are better than the team, but want success equally for both.

### Work-life balance vs Overwork
* For many people, work is an important part of life, not something to be separated.
* keep the work part lively and full; it's _not_ a key component of your job to ensure that employees consistently have a forty-hour workweek.
* tell them to own the things for which they are responsible, and they will do what it takes to get them done. Give them the space and the freedom to make it happen.
* burnout isn't caused by working too hard, but by resentment at having to give up what really matters to you. Give your smart creatives control, and they will usually make their own best decisions about how to balance their lives.
* No one should or can be indispensable.

### Culture of Yes
* No is a signal that the company has lots its start-up verve, that it's too corporate. Enough no's, and smart creatives stop asking and start heading to the exits.
* "_My first word of advice is this: Say yes. In fact, say yes as often as you can. Saying yes begins things. Saying yes is how things grow. Saying yes leads to new experiences and new experiences will lead you to knowledge and wisdom.... An attitude of yes is how you will be able to go forward in these uncertain times._" - Michael Hogan (American academic and former University of Connecticut president)

### fun vs Fun
* A great start-up, a great project - a great job, for that matter - should be fun, and if you're working your but-off without deriving any enjoyment, something's probably wrong. Part of the fun comes from inhaling the fumes of future success. But a lot of it comes from laughing and joking an enjoying the company of your coworkers.
* The fun comes from everywhere. The key is to set the boundaries of what is permissible as broadly as possible.

### Leadership
* the CEO who picks up the stack of newspapers outside the front door, the founder who wipes the counters. With these actions, the leaders demonstrate their egalitarian natures - we're all in this together and none of us are above the menial tasks that need to get done. Mostly, though, they do it because they care so much about the company. Leadership requires passion. If you don't have it, get out now.
